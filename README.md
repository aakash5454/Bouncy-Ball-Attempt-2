# Bouncy-Ball-Attempt-2
The Bouncy Ball Game 

As the name suggests this is my second attempt to make a simple iOS game.
This is a game based on the side lines of Arkanoid.
The idea of building this mini project was to 
(1)Get hands on using IBOutletCollection
(2)Configuring Audio Player for App
(3)Gesture recognition
(4)Using NSTimers and other small stuff.
